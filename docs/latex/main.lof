\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {}{\ignorespaces Architecture of the Direction AN model. The shared stem processes architecture of the Direction AN model. The shared stem processes time and context inputs to produce a latent representation \(z(t, c)\). Three specialized branches (translation, rotation, mass) map this latent space to the corresponding state components. The physics residual layer computes dynamics residuals to enforce physical consistency.}}{29}{}%
\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {}{\ignorespaces Model selection process for the Direction AN architecture. Summarizes the selection process used to refine the network architecture. Architectural choices were guided by observed training stability, sensitivity to input scaling, and the ability to balance heterogeneous loss components, rather than by exhaustive hyperparameter search.}}{31}{}%

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {}{\ignorespaces shows the vertical position as a function of time. The PINN prediction closely follows the reference solution over the full ascent phase, with a visible but small deviation near the end of the time horizon.}}{40}{}%

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {}{\ignorespaces compares the predicted mass evolution against the reference solution. During the propulsive phase, the predicted mass follows the general decreasing trend of the reference. After propellant depletion, the reference mass remains constant, while the predicted mass exhibits small fluctuations around the terminal value.}}{42}{}%

\contentsline {figure}{\numberline {}{\ignorespaces evaluates compliance with the mass monotonicity constraint by plotting the time derivative of mass. The reference trajectory shows no violations, while the predicted trajectory exhibits multiple instances where the monotonicity condition is violated.}}{48}{}%
